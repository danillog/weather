This site is create with ReactJS, Open Weahter API and Nomination API. 

## Describe

I created this site to visualize the weather of different cities in the world, but with colors adaptable to my local time.

### Why use nomination API ?

In the first moment I created this project I needed the user to enter the name of the region in the search field and I found the geographic location through this information. The solution he found was to use the nomination API.
